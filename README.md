# Week Four Independent Project 

The task is to predict result of a game between team 1 and team 2, based on who's home and who's away, and on whether or not the game is friendly (include rank in your training).

Input: Home team, Away team, Tournament type (World cup, Friendly, Other)

## Approches Used 

Approach 1: Polynomial approach

What to train given:

Rank of home team
Rank of away team
Tournament type

Model 1: Predict how many goals the home team scores.

Model 2: Predict how many goals the away team scores.

Approach 2: Logistic approach

Feature Engineering: Figure out from the home team’s perspective if the game is a Win, Lose or Draw (W, L, D)


## The flow for the project:

Perform your EDA
Perform any necessary feature engineering 
Check of multicollinearity
Start building the model
Cross-validate the model
Compute RMSE
Create residual plots for your models, and assess their heteroscedasticity using Bartlett’s test

## Installation

The project has been carried out on Google Colaboratory.

## Technologies Used

Python, pandas, NumPy
